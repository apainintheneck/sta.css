Todo:  
- Change button design.  
- Change box design to allow full width images inside.  
- Create three more basic themes.  
- Add the ability to select text easily between <code> tags.  
- Find out how to merge only certain files between gh-pages and main branches(might be able to use .gitignore for this purpose).  
- Find out how to change CSS @import statement in the sta.css file to allow multiple different config-sta.css files to be changed to allow themes to be tried in realtime.  
- Add the ability to zoom when images are clicked without js.
- Add modals without js to be used for menu bars.
- Add fixed headers and footers.
